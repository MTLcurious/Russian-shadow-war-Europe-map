# Russian-shadow-war-Europe-map
Here is a little project I worked on in the last week. Thanks to the great work of Dr. Bart Schuurman, Professor of Terrorism and Political Violence, at Leiden University, I have made a map of the shadow war conducted by Putin's regime in Europe following his invasion of Ukraine. The aim of this project is to better visualize the scale of this strategy and how it targets almost every european country.

All rights to Dr. Bart Schuurman for the data. I want to thank him and his team for making these data publicly available. The link for the data is below.
